    <h2>Cobblestone</h2>
    <p>This is Cobblestone, it's a notetaking app based on EyeScary Development's <a href="https://eyescary.uk/harmony">Harmony code editor</a>, it features the same great experience, and just replaces the syntax highlighting with markdown interpreted by the Lead markdown interpreter</p>
    <h3>Why is it called cobblestone?</h3>
    <p>because lava and water make cobblestone and obsidian, and cobblestone is worse than obsidian in every way</p>
    <h3>How get?</h3>
    <p>just get EyeScary Development's <a href="eyescary.uk/agpm">AGPM package manager</a> and you can install it with that, the command is cobble btw when you install it</p>
